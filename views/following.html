The screenplay, written by Rafael Moreu, is highly inspired by the hacker and cyberpunk subcultures. 
He saw the film as more than just about computer hacking but something much larger: &quot;In fact, to call hackers a counterculture makes it sound like they're a transitory thing; I think they're the next step in human evolution.&quot;  He had been interested in hacking since the early 1980s. After the crackdown in the United States during 1989 and 1990, he decided to write a script about the subculture. For research, Moreu went to a meeting organized by the New York-based hacker magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. There, he met Phiber Optik, a.k.a. Mark Abene, a 22-year-old hacker who spent most of 1994 in prison on hacking charges. Moreu also hung out with other young hackers being harassed by the government and began to figure out how it would translate into a film. He remembered, &quot;One guy was talking about how he'd done some really interesting stuff with a laptop and payphones and that cracked it for me, because it made it cinematic&quot;. The character Eugene Belford uses Babbage as a pseudonym at the end of the film, a reference to Charles Babbage, an inventor of an early form of the computer. The fictional computer mainframe named the &quot;Gibson&quot; is a homage to cyberpunk author William Gibson and originator of the term &quot;Cyberspace&quot;, first in his 1982 short story &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; and later in his 1984 book Neuromancer.
